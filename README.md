## Overview

The livestock sector in Bangladesh is a cornerstone of the national economy and rural livelihoods, contributing approximately 1.9% to the national GDP and 16.52% to the agricultural GDP. However, it faces critical challenges including limited veterinary access, delayed disease detection, and insufficient feeding guidance.

GemmaVetCare addresses these gaps through:
- **Multilingual support** (English and Bangla)
- **Offline capabilities** for rural areas with limited connectivity
- **AI-powered multimodal disease diagnosis**
- **Context-aware nutritional recommendations**

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**üì± Device Requirements:**
- **High-end devices are preferred** for optimal performance
- Android API level 24+ required
- Sufficient storage space for AI model (approximately 1.5GB)

1. **Download the APK**
   - Download the latest release: [GemmaVetCare APK](https://github.com/Sadatul/GemmaVetCare/releases/download/1.0.0-RELEASE/app-debug.apk)
   - Install the APK on your Android device

2. **Download the AI Model**
   - Open the app and navigate to "Ask Disease" section
   - Download the **LoRa-3n-DDX-ft-in4** model (fine-tuned Gemma-3n 2b model)
   - **Wait for the model to load completely** - this may take a few minutes
   - This step is essential for all features to work properly

3. **Enable GPU Acceleration (Recommended for High-End Devices)**
   - In the "Ask Disease" page, look for the **tuning icon** in the **top left corner**
   - Click on the tuning icon and select **"GPU"** option
   - **Wait for the model to reload** with GPU acceleration
   - This will result in **much faster response times** for disease detection

4. **Complete Setup**
   - Once the model is loaded (with or without GPU), all app features will be fully accessible
   - The app now works completely offline with AI-powered disease diagnosis and nutrition guidance

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- Model loading time varies based on device specifications
- GPU acceleration significantly improves performance on compatible devices
- Be patient during initial model loading - it's a one-time setup process


## Key Features

### üî¨ Disease Detection

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Architecture Pattern**: MVVM with Compose state management
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Disease Diagnosis**: Google AI Edge framework with Gemma-3n-e2b-it model
- **Nutrition Prediction**: Embedded scikit-learn Random Forest regressors
- **Model Optimization**: LoRA fine-tuning and quantization techniques

### Data Management
- **Local Database**: Room persistence library with SQLite
- **Model Storage**: Secure internal storage with versioning
- **Caching**: Android DataStore preferences and Glide image caching

## Performance Metrics

### Disease Detection Results
- **Significant improvement** in precision, recall, and F1-scores compared to MobileNet baseline
- **Strong performance** in Lumpy Skin Disease and Pinkeye detection
- **Multimodal approach** enhances diagnostic accuracy

### Nutrition Prediction Accuracy
- **Random Forest**: Lowest MAE for TDN (0.62 lbs) and NEm (0.02 Mcal)
- **CatBoost**: Best performance for NEg (0.22 Mcal) and CP (0.05 lbs)
- **Consistent low RMSE and MAPE** values across all models

## Model Development

### Disease Detection Model
The disease detection system uses a LoRA-fine-tuned Gemma-3n-e2b-it model trained on annotated cattle images with Bangla symptom descriptions.

### Nutrition Models
Random Forest regressors are trained on standardized nutritional datasets to predict cattle-specific nutrient requirements based on:
- Cattle type and breed
- Weight and age
- Growth stage (pregnant, lactating, growing)
- Average daily gain

## Impact and Benefits

### For Farmers
- **Accessible veterinary care** in remote areas
- **Early disease detection** reducing livestock mortality
- **Optimized feeding practices** improving productivity
- **Cost-effective solutions** for small-scale farmers

### For the Livestock Sector
- **Extended veterinary reach** through digital platforms
- **Reduced economic losses** from disease outbreaks
- **Improved productivity** through better nutrition management
- **Data-driven decision making** for livestock management
